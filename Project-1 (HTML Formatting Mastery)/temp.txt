                Hello! My name is Vikash Kuamr Mehta, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from Meerut Institute of Technology (MIT), which is affiliated with Chaudhary Charan Singh University (CCSU), Meerut. <br>
                As a dedicated and enthusiastic student, I am passionate about learning and exploring various areas of computer science and modern technology. <br>
                I have a strong interest in programming, web development, and software applications, and I continuously seek opportunities to enhance my knowledge and practical skills. <br>

                I have successfully completed several training programs and certification courses, including advanced Python programming and web development. <br>
                I am also gaining hands-on experience by working on real-life projects like a Bank management System and a Campus Issue Tracker Web Application. <br>
                These projects are helping me build expertise in technologies like Python, Flask, HTML, MySQL, and Streamlit.

                With a mindset focused on learning and innovation, I aim to contribute positively to the tech industry. <br>
                I am excited to continue my academic journey and explore internships or collaborative projects that can help me grow both personally and professionally.
