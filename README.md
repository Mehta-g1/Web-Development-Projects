# Web Development Projects

Welcome to my **Web Development Projects** repository! This is a comprehensive and evolving portfolio documenting my journey to master full stack web development. Here, you'll find a wide variety of projects—ranging from the simplest HTML pages to complex, full-stack applications—demonstrating both foundational skills and advanced concepts.

> **Note:**  
> This repository is currently private as it is part of my personal learning process. It will be made public once I have completed my initial study phase and am ready to share my progress with the community.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

This repository serves two purposes:
- **Portfolio:** Showcasing my progression from beginner to advanced web development through real, hands-on projects.
- **Reference Archive:** A resource for myself and others, with each project focusing on unique aspects or challenges in web development.

## 🌱 Project Progression

> **About Project Complexity:**  
> The projects are intentionally organized in sequence to reflect a clear learning path. As the project number increases, so does the complexity and the range of skills and technologies involved:
> - **Early Projects (e.g., Project 1):** Extremely simple, focusing solely on basic HTML and fundamental web structure.
> - **Middle Projects:** Gradually introduce CSS for styling, then JavaScript for interactivity, and start combining different frontend techniques.
> - **Later Projects:** Feature more advanced front-end frameworks (like React), introduce backend technologies (such as Django), and integrate databases (like MySQL).
> - **Latest Projects:** These are full-stack apps using a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Django, MySQL, and possibly other modern web technologies.
>
> This progression is designed to illustrate my growth and the increasing complexity of the challenges I take on.
